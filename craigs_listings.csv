 Julia Child gives us her magnum opus--the distillation of a lifetime of cooking!

In this spirit, Julia has conceived her most creative and instructive cookbook, blending classic techniques with free-style American cooking and with added emphasis on lightness, freshness, and simpler preparations. Breaking with conventional organization, she structures the chapters (from Soups to Cakes & Cookies) around master recipes, giving all the reassuring details that she is so good at and grouping the recipes according to method; these are followed--in shorthand form--by innumerable variations that are easily made once the basics are understood.

In all, there are more than 800 recipes, including the variations--from a treasure trove of poultry and fish recipes and a vast array of fresh vegetables prepared in new ways to bread doughs (that can be turned into pizzas and calzones and hamburger buns) and delicious indulgences, such as Caramel Apple Mountain or a Queen of Sheba Chocolate Almond Cake with Chocolate Leaves. And if you want to know how a finished dish should look or how to angle your knife or to fashion a pretty rosette on that cake, there are more than 600 color photographs to entice and instruct you along the way.

A one-of-a-kind, brilliant, and inspiring book from the incomparable Julia!

Kevlar, the miracle fiber from DuPont, is literally bulletproof. Factory-built Kevlar canoes are light (35 pounds for a 17-Footer), strong (40% stronger than fiberglass canoes that weigh twice as much), fast, and maintenance-free. They offer just about everything except a reasonable price. But cost is no longer an obstacle. With this book, the most inexperienced home builder can turn out a handsome canoe for an investment of $600 (20% to 30% of the typical purchase price) in one or two weekends. Moran's low-tech method for building these high-tech boats centers on the pink foam sheathing used on houses, a $5 plane, and drywall compound. The method is astonishingly easy and forgiving. The book provides complete plans and building instructions for a stable family canoe, a swift solo canoe, and a wilderness tripper.",like new,"Arts, Crafts & Photography",

"Peter Zumthor Works: Buildings and Projects, 1979-1997",900,"Peter Zumthor is possibly the most innovative European architect working today.
His projects inspire enthusiasm with their exactitude, their poetry, and their radically independent aesthetics and vocabulary of form.
This publication, exquisitely designed to the architect's exacting standards, is the first complete survey of Zumthor's oeuvre.
As exceptional as the architect's work itself, the book investigates eight realized buildings in detail, including the Home for the Elderly in Chur,
the Gugalun House in Safiental, the Art Museum in Bregenz, Austria, and his best-known work, the Thermal Baths in Vals, Switzerland.
Each of these projects is extensively illustrated with duotone photographs by British architectural photographer Helene Binet and is accompanied
by plans as well as commentary written by Zumthor himself.
This title also includes a list of projects, a biography of the architect, and an introduction by Zumthor.

Since this collection was made,all printings of Zumthors works have been very hard to find,making this a very rare and
much sought-after item. Many people believe this book in particular, to be one of the most significant works available from
any author, living or dead.The mans genius is on full display,with hundreds of beautiful photographs to inspire the mind.
Amazon has the book listed at $1,800.00 Used, i am asking $900 or the best offer. 
if you are interested,get in touch with me and we can discuss price options.

The condition of the book is beautiful.it has been carefully stored and wrapped for the last decade and will ship very securely packaged if needed.
willing to meet for serious buyers only. cash only. Email me with any questions.

"Rare 1947 Mexican Cook Book, Eng/Span, 368 pg. Velazquez de Leon",75,"1947 edition of the book “Mexican Cook Book Devoted to the American Homes”.  It is written by famous author Josefina Velazquez de Leon (see Wikipedia for her extensive history), who was the Director of the Culinary Arts Institute in Mexico City.  The paperback book, with jacket, is written in both English and Spanish, and contains 368 pages of information, sketches, and recipes.

The full title of the cookbook is: “Mexican Cook Book Devoted to the American Homes: Recipes of Mexican Cookery of Each Region of the Mexican Country, Adopting Its Ingredients, to the Elements that Can be Substituted in the Northern Part of the United States, Central Republic and South America, Written in Two Languages: English and Spanish”.

Because it is relatively rare, and due to the fame of the author, this cook book sells on Etsy for $225, and on Amazon in its later printing for even more.

Condition: Book is very readable and usable.  Binding is tight, no marks on pages except a few age spots. One edge has spot on it. Cover edges are worn.  Book jacket is in poor condition. Colors are good, but it is taped together and has tears and spill marks. (Pic of title page is not a tear - faint crease that the scanner picked up).
Size: 8 inches high x 6 inches wide x 1 inch thick

Further information:
-From Wikipedia: In the cooking school, Velázquez de León traveled to various states of the country promoting a national gastronomy proposal based on the relationship between good eating, family spending, nutrition, history, and regional cuisine. Velázquez de León promoted a revaluation of home cooking in addition to classifying and cataloging the diversity of dishes of national cuisine. In her cooking classes she taught modules and subjects such as: daily simple cooking, modern cooking, haute cuisine, simple baking, artistic jellies, and Mexican specialties.
-A blog entry with one of the recipes from this cookbook: https://blogs.library.duke.edu/rubenstein/2016/02/26/11846/

The Rite of Sodomy - Homosexuality&The Catholic Church,60,"The Rite of Sodomy tracks the rise of homosexuality in the Catholic hierarchy, diocesan priesthood and religious life in the United States over a span of 100 years and three generations of prelates. It examines all facets of this inter-generational phenomenon on the life of the Church – yesterday, today and tomorrow.
The text is broken down into five mini-book sections each examining a different aspect of homosexuality in the Roman Catholic Church.

    Section I looks at pederasty, homosexuality in its most pervasive and universal form, from Antiquity to the Middle Ages, to the Renaissance, to the rise of the Modern State in the mid-to-late 1800s.
    Section II exams the complex nature and causes of male homosexuality, describes homosexual acts and behaviors, and provides an in-depth look at the secular Homosexual Collective and the inordinate power it exerts over the individual homosexual.
    Sections III and IV document the growth of the vice within the American Church (AmChurch) with special attention to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops/U.S. Catholic Conference and Catholic dioceses headed by homosexual cardinals and bishops. There is biographical data on more than 30 homosexual prelates and detailed case studies on homosexuality and pederasty in six major religious orders. A carefully researched  report on New Ways Ministry, one of the most influential pro-homosexual auxiliary organizations in AmChurch, illustrates the total ineptitude of the Holy See in confronting morally subversive agencies within its own ranks.
    Section V brings all elements of the controversy over homosexuality in the Catholic Church under one roof – the dome of St. Peter’s. An examination of the role played by Pope
    Section V brings all elements of the controversy over homosexuality in the Catholic Church under one roof – the dome of St. Peter’s. An examination of the role played by Pope Paul VI in connection with the rise of a “gay” clergy in the Universal Church brings this blockbuster work to its startling conclusion.
    The Rite of Sodomy contains 4,523 endnotes, a bibliography of over 350 books, and a full index.",excellent,Religion & Spirituality,

Child-Craft Vinatage Hardback V1-15,20,"This is a prestine (lightly used) full volume (15) of Child-Craft hardback 1954 books.

The Childcraft series was originally created in 1934 by W. F. Quarrie & Company, then publishers of the World Book encyclopedia. The series' title was Childcraft – The How and Why Library.

Childcraft was created as a sort of encyclopedia for young children. With simple texts and illustrations, the volumes were designed to make learning fun. Each volume addressed different subjects, including literature — such as short stories and poetry, including fairy tales and nursery rhymes — as well as mathematics and the sciences.

Starting out as seven volumes in the late 1930s, the series was re-issued in a new edition every few years, sometimes incorporating new volumes and re-arranging existing ones. It grew to 15 volumes in the 1950s, and remained there, though further changes were made in later editions.

The 15 volumes of Childcraft, published by World Book, Inc., currently consist of:

Once Upon a Time- short stories and folk tales.
Art Around Us
Poems and Rhymes - poetry
How Things Work
How Does it Happen?
Our Earth
Our Universe
Shapes and Numbers
The World of Animals

The Misfits of Channel 10,19,"This is a book inspired by the author’s experiences growing up in the 60’s. 

Did you have a troubled childhood or a hard time dealing with the changes of adolescence? Were you perpetually on the outside looking in? Did you turn toward Citizen Band or Amateur Radio? Was Lafayette Radio Electronics, Heath-kit or Allied Radio (Knight-kit) an important part of your adolescence? Do you ever think back to the days of your youth when life was simpler?  

It includes  large description & diagrams of Lafayette Radio Electronics Syosset warehouse store and catalogs. It also describes  the actions that led to its demise. Do you know what yearly Lafayette catalog was never published?

This is a story about loners that yearn to belong and learn to create a common bond with others like themselves as voices over the Citizen Band radio.

Join me for a nostalgic look at the awkwardness of coming of age in the 60’s and not being one of the “in crowd” in “The Misfits of Channel 10.”

Euroquake by Daniel Burstein,10,"Euroquake : Europe's Explosive Economic Challenge Will Change The World by Daniel Burstein
Published by Simon & Schuster Ltd, 1991

The Euroquake in prospect is an economic one. By 1993 Europe will be a bigger market than the US. By 1995 there is a real prospect of a single European currency. By 2000 a unified Germany will have become the economic and industrial engine of a new European Superstate. Daniel Burstein, who analysed the significance, of the new Japanese financial empire, in ""Yen!"", now turns his attention to Europe. He argues that the collapse of communism could bring into being a new world order in which fear of military warfare is replaced by economic warfare, and in which business leaders and managers will play a role as important as that of presidents and prime ministers. In the next century, three different market economies - based upon Europe, Japan and the US - will compete for power and world dominance. Burstein also predicts that, with weak capital resources, the US may find itself the smallest player in a three cornered contest with Europe to the fore. With more than 100 specific predictions for change by the year 2000, ""Euroquake"", is a challenging book.",excellent,Biographies & Memoirs,

 Kevin P. Keefe (Author) 

The against-all-odds story of a World War II–era steam locomotive and the determination of two generations of volunteers to keep it running comes alive in Twelve Twenty-Five: The Life and Times of a Steam Locomotive.

Pere Marquette 1225 was built in 1941 at the peak of steam locomotive development. The narrative traces the 1225’s regular freight service in Michigan, its unlikely salvation from the scrapyard for preservation at Michigan State University, and the subsequent work to bring it back to steam, first by a student club and later by a railroad museum. Milestones along the way include 1225’s retirement in 1951, its donation to MSU in 1957, its return to steam in 1988, a successful career hauling tens of thousands of excursion riders, and its starring role in the 2004 movie The Polar Express. The massive infrastructure that supported American steam locomotives in their heyday disappeared long ago, forcing 1225’s faithful to make their own spare parts, learn ancient railroad skills, and interpret the entire effort for the public. As such, the continuing career of 1225 is a triumph of historic preservation.",new,Children's Books,

*** The New Parenting Handbook ***,15,"The New Parenting Handbook: Understanding Why Children Do What They Do, Paperback – August 2019

This book was published in August 2019 and is available on Amazon for $22.99.
You can save $8.00 (+ tax) if you buy it direct.

""From the Terrible Twos all the way through the rebellious teen years, our culture and language around parenting frames the experience as an endless martyrdom of confrontation and correction. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Modern brain imaging can tell us why children do what they do, giving us insight and understanding to avoid the time-worn hassles and struggles. We are entering a new era of cooperative, self-disciplined children, made possible for you by straight talk and proven strategies from certified parent educator Shirley Luxem. First, she turns upside down the common belief that life with children is unavoidably unpleasant and exhausting. Then, she opens your eyes to the innumerable ways adults incite the very behaviors they seek to correct. Finally, she leads you step by step through one aha moment after another, to solutions that create and restore peace and joy in family living. The New Parenting Handbook is an essential read for parents and caregivers of children of all ages.""

For Kelly Corrigan, family is everything. At thirty-six, she had a marriage that worked, two funny, active kids, and a weekly newspaper column. But even as a thriving adult, Kelly still saw herself as the daughter of garrulous Irish-American charmer George Corrigan. She was living deep within what she calls the Middle Place--""that sliver of time when parenthood and childhood overlap""--comfortably wedged between her adult duties and her parents' care. But Kelly is abruptly shoved into coming-of-age when she finds a lump in her breast--and gets the diagnosis no one wants to hear. When George, too, learns that he has late-stage cancer, it is Kelly's turn to take care of the man who had always taken care of her--and to show us a woman who finally takes the leap and grows up.

VANCOUVER - A Year in Motion (Photographic Essay),10,"I'm actually on the east coast (New York to be specific) but thought there would be more interest in this photo essay in Washington, and I frequently ship books (Media Mail) out of state.

* A photographic portrait of Vancouver, British Columbia, at a pivotal point in its history -- the year of Expo 86 and the year of the city's 100th birthday.

* A big, beautiful, coffee table book, profusely illustrated throughout with color photographs and journalists' descriptions.

* Blue cloth cover, gilt lettering to front panel and spine, photographic dust jacket.

* Light wear to dust jacket; otherwise, a bright, clean copy, solidly bound and unmarked (NOT x-library, NO owner names); just some light wear to DJ and a short tear on DJ, carefully repaired on reverse.

* In this magnificent and unusual book, almost 200 photographs give you an insider's view of the special qualities of a city that some say may be the most beautiful place on earth.  Vancouver: A Year in Motion provides firsthand glimpses of a city that combines cosmopolitan energy and spectacular natural beauty, satisfying everyone, from the most urbane city dweller to the avid outdoor enthusiast.

* Fifty photographers who live and work in Vancouver spent a year photographing their city to create a vivid and vital memento for Vancouverites and those who visit Expo 86 during the centennial year.  This book was named the official book of the centennial.

* First Edition, 10 3/4"" by 13 1/2"".  208 pages.  A very heavy, oversize volume, weighing 4.7 lbs (2.1 kg).

* Produced by Tom Sutherland and Cindy Bellamy.

LIFE & TIMES OF WASHINGTON 2 VOLS COMPLETE BROADWAY COMEDY INTEREST,40,"""Life and Times of Washington"" by Frederick John Schroeder and Benson John Lossing. Introduction by Edward C. Towne. 

Two volume set, complete as issued. Bound in gilt stamped cloth.  M. M. Belcher Publishing Co. Albany, New York, 1903. Hardcover. Octavo. 

The cover of both volumes has a gilt framed picture of ""The Yankee Doodle Comedian George M. Cohan Colonial Theatre.""    An excellent biography of the first United States president and a very nice collector's item in the history of American comedy.  George Cohan was called ""The Father of Broadway"" and was the subject of a major picture with James Cagney in the lead.  Has about forty illustrations, all are plates.  2032 pages. 

Has a small paper label glued on front endpaper (FFEP's) of both volumes of ""S.H. Lindstrom's Private Library.""  Each volume has pencil side lines next to paragraphs on about 150 to 200 pages, a few rare ""x's""  and a handwritten set of notes with historical dates on two back endpapers.  The erasing of them doesn't do anything to the paper, as the paper is very strong. All these of these can be erased and most of them are fairly light.   One plate called The First Cabinet"" has the figures describe with occupation written in pencil.  There are 2032 pages total so these blend in a little. Otherwise, very good condition on both volumes.  

A good price for the hardcover set without the special nature of this edition.",0,Fiction,
2 EARLY CHRISTIAN FICTION: MARK OF BEAST & STEPHEN SOLDIER OF CROSS,20,"Stephen: a Soldier of the Cross by Florence M Kingsley.

Previous owner's old bookplate and signature on front endpaper, and note on blank flyleaf with another owner's name and saying it can be borrowed but please return.  Front endpaper has tear at binding making it loose at bottom but in no danger of coming out since it's completely bound in at top half, otherwise about very good condition.  

""The Mark of the Beast,"" by Sydney Watson. 

Early end times fiction from 1918 originally.  This is the 1933 reprint.  

The photo doesn't do the dust jacket justice because the front looking straight at it looks very clear and bright. 

Very good condition book in very good dust jacket.  There are two sheets (4 pages) that have a small bit of the top missing but it does not effect any text.  Previous owner's gift inscription with Isaiah 9:15 on front flyleaf.

The Sixth Sun,17,"This book provides a brief history of man over several thousand years and a 4000+ year tale of the rise and progression of mankind after a major natural disaster and the enormous influence of gods and religion on mankind's actions and beliefs. It covers a lot of time and involves an extensive array of characters superbly mixing history and science fiction encompassing three planets over a 40,000 year period prior to mankind being saved.

One reader says:

Interesting and entertaining. If one has any knowledge of the history of mankind over the last 4-6000 years you come to recognize very quickly how well the novel captures man's, not only folly, but predictability. Even a cursory look at the geopolitical, economic and environmental situation in the world today suggests that this author has it right. Religion, politics, power and greed has in the past, is currently and will continue to create unrest, divide and ultimately doom mankind to war, the defense of opposing ideologies, the fight for survival at all cost and the inability to live in harmony. Man, more than any other species on earth is an ideologically driven, aggressive, warring creature.

The World in Flames: A World War II Sourcebook,20,"ISBN-13: 978-0195174427
ISBN-10: 0195174429

Used but in a very good condition and like new.

An edited volume of primary sources from the Second World War, The World in Flames: A World War II Sourcebook is the first of its kind to provide an ambitious and wide-ranging survey of the war in a convenient and comprehensive package. Conveying the sheer scale and reach of the conflict, the book's twelve chapters include sufficient narrative and analysis to enable students to grasp both the war's broad outlines and the context and significance of each particular source. 

Beginning with the growing disenchantment over the World War I peace settlements and the determination of German, Italian, and Japanese leaders to revise the situation, the book traces the descent into open, armed conflict. It covers the spectacular early successes of the Germans and Japanese, the pivotal campaigns of 1942, and the Allied effort during the remaining three years to destroy the Axis' capacity to wage war. Drawing examples from a wide range of documents, the text also includes visual sources: propaganda posters, photos, and cartoons.",0,History,
World War II: A New History,10,"ISBN-13: 978-0521608435
ISBN-10: 0521608430

Used but in very good condition and like new.

This book is a magisterial global history of World War II. Beginning in 1937 with the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Evan Mawdsley shows how the origins of World War II lay in a conflict between the old international order and the new and then traces the globalisation of the conflict as it swept through Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. His primary focus is on the war's military and strategic history though he also examines the political, economic, ideological, and cultural factors which influenced the course of events. The war's consequences are examined too, not only in terms of the defeat of the Axis but also the break-up of colonial empires and the beginning of the Cold War. Accessibly written and well-illustrated with maps and photographs, this compelling new account also includes short studies of the key figures, events and battles that shaped the war.",0,History,
