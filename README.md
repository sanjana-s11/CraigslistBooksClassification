Dependencies
------------
1. Team_ExtrAUDinary_Scraping.py

	(1) Install Selenium using pip (pip install selenium)
	(2) Next, install chromedriver on your system:
		https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
	Select the appropriate file based on Chrome version of your system and operating system.
	(3) Place the downloaded chromedriver.exe file in the same folder as this python file. (This executable is included in the submitted zip folder.)
	(4) Create a subfolder called BookImages if it doesn't already exist to store the scraped images.


2. Team_ExtrAUDinary_Modeling.py

	craigs_listings.csv and book32-listing.csv files are used as inputs to this python file. Place them in the same folder as this python file.


3. Team_ExtrAUDinary_OCR.py

	(1) Install pytesseract using pip (pip install pytesseract)
	(2) Next, install pytesseract on your system:
		1. For Windows, there are 2 links:
			https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/
			https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
		2. For Mac/Linux:
			https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
	(3) Note down the save path, since youâ€™ll be needing it in the next steps
	(4) Import pytesseract in your program
	(5) Add pytesseract to your path using command:
		pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd=r'C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
	Now, you can run the tesseract image-to-string function used in this python file.

	(6) Place the '5 books' folder which has the input images in the same folder as this python file.
